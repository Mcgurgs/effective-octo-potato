Hello everyone, this is my first project. The project mainly is based off of things I recently learned from reading and videos. 
I plan to keep working through Automate The Boring Stuff while practicing daily. Things I'm interested in learning ASAP: 
Pandas, Matplotlib, and other data visualization tools. 

Feel free to reach out about suggestions! :D

I'm redoing this repository. On my profile there is a repo called 'FirstProject.py' -This is the new repo so I can learn to do correct and get practice with:
Git, Github, CMD, local repo + remote, branches, etc.
