Hello everyone, this is my first small Python project. I used things I've recently learned from 'Automate The Boring Stuff' By Al Sweigart'
It's a basic program to take user input , validate user input , pull from dict , and add to the dict if wanted 
--> Constructive critism wanted :D

Fixes planning to work on = get rid of time.sleep() , build intro inside of type_text , please comment for other suggestions.
